# Udacians for Android
Networking Community By and For Udacity Students

## About

The Udacians community is a mobile-first social network for [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) students. What's that, you ask? It's an app to bring campus-like networking opportunities to online students in the palm of their hands. Students can find others in their area, organize meetups, and talk tech with their virtual classmates. By bringing an accessible networking platform outside the virtual classroom, the Udacians app aims to encourage in-classroom success for Udacity's awesome students.

## Status

The Android app is currently in the final stage of beta testing and will be available on Google Play Store soon. I'm also porting it to iOS. The process is going quite _Swiftly_ I might add :)

## See It In Action

While waiting for the 1.0 release...

You can run the app from android studio using the installRelease Gradle task.
